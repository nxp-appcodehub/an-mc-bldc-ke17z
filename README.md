# an-mc-bldc-ke17z
This application note demonstrates how to implement the six-step commutation control of brushless direct current(BLDC) motor on KE17Z512 and KE17Z256 MCUs. The NXP Freedom board FRDM-MC-LVBLDC is used as a hardware platform for the motor control reference solution. The hardware-dependent part of the motor control software is addressed as well.
